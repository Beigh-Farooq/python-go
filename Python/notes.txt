-->>Types of Recursion?
1) Head Recursion
	When a function calls itself and that called statement is the first statement in a function
	then it is called as heard recursion.
	There should be no statements before the recursive call.
	So between base condition and recursion call there should not be any statement.
2)Tail Recursion
	When a function calls itself and that called statement is the last statement in a function
	then it is called as tail recursion.
3)Tree Recursion?

4)Indirect Recursion: 
	So if we have functions in such a way that they are more than one function and each function depending
	upon the base condition calls the other function.
	And finally, the last function, depending upon the base condition called the first function.
	Then this is known as indirect recursion.

	But always remember that in indirect recursion, the function will not call itself the function will
	call another function and that function may call another function and so on, till the last function
	will make a call to the first function.

--> __slots__ :
	The underscore underscore, slots underscored underscored, since is the built
	in class level, member and class level members are preceded and succeeded by double underscored characters.
	And assign the instance variables as our underscored element within single codes, followed by comma
	and underscored next within single codes.
